// With two buffers, the rendering and refreshing of the display become parallel operations
// Second buffer needs 15.360 bytes more memory in heap.

// A second buffer only pays off if my_disp_flush() returns before the transfer is finished. LVGL
// then renders the next area into the second buffer while the first one is still being sent.
// That needs two things: a driver that can send asynchronously, and a flush that does not wait for
// the end of the transfer.
// my_disp_flush() below has both paths: an asynchronous one that keeps the write transaction open
// (startWrite() once, no endWrite()) and sends the buffer with a zero copy DMA, and a synchronous
// one that waits for the transfer in endWrite(). Which one is used is decided at runtime by
// lvgl_flush_async, because the asynchronous path also needs the buffers in DMA capable RAM.
//
// Measured on rev5 (ESP32-S3, 8 bit parallel), full screen redraw with LVGL:
//   LovyanGFX, zero copy and asynchronous  26.2 ms (38 fps)
//   LovyanGFX, synchronous                 30.0 ms (33 fps)
