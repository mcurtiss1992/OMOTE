// With two buffers, the rendering and refreshing of the display become parallel operations
// Second buffer needs 15.360 bytes more memory in heap.

// A second buffer only pays off if my_disp_flush() returns before the transfer is finished. LVGL
// then renders the next area into the second buffer while the first one is still being sent.
// That needs two things: a driver that can send asynchronously, and a flush that does not wait for
// the end of the transfer.
// my_disp_flush() in displaydriver0_LovyanGFX.cpp has both paths: an asynchronous one that keeps
// the write transaction open (startWrite() once, no endWrite()) and sends the buffer with a zero
// copy DMA, and a synchronous one that waits for the transfer in endWrite(). Which one is used is
// decided at runtime by lvgl_flush_async, because the asynchronous path also needs the buffers in
// DMA capable RAM.
//
// Measured on rev5 (ESP32-S3, 8 bit parallel), full screen redraw with LVGL:
//   LovyanGFX, zero copy and asynchronous  26.2 ms (38 fps)
//   LovyanGFX, synchronous                 30.0 ms (33 fps)
//   Arduino_GFX ESP32PAR8, no DMA          82.9 ms (12 fps) - slow, but chosen here in the hope that the lower switching rate reduces ghost touches
//
// Which of the two paths is taken is decided by two switches, one at compile time and one at run
// time:
//
//   DISPLAY_DRIVER_CAN_FLUSH_ASYNC        can this driver do it at all?
//     defined right below, for the drivers that can start a transfer and return before it is
//     finished. Every other driver leaves it undefined.
//        |
//        | if defined: ask for two buffers in internal DMA capable RAM (init_lvgl_buffer())
//        v
//   lvgl_flush_async                      does it actually do it?
//     set at run time, and only true if DISPLAY_DRIVER_CAN_FLUSH_ASYNC is defined AND both
//     allocations really succeeded. Driver cannot do it, allocation failed, fallback taken - in
//     all of those cases it stays false, which is also its initial value.

//   my_disp_flush()                       has to honour lvgl_flush_async

//     starts rendering into the buffer again as soon as lv_disp_flush_ready() was called, and
//     with one buffer that is the buffer being sent.
